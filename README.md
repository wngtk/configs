My personal configuration files. They are designed for a FISH + TMUX + NEOVIM stack.

- `./shell-setup.sh` â€“ will bootstrap the shell environment.
- `./install` - Will link dotfiles using dotbot.

If you install Dotbot from PyPI and call it as a command-line program. You can invoke Dotbot with `dotbot -c <path to configuration file>`
